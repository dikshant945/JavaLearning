//ðŸš€ Problem Statement: Design a Food Delivery System
//You are required to design and implement a basic food delivery system similar to Swiggy/Zomato using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
//
//    ðŸ“Œ Functional Requirements:
//Add a Restaurant
//
//Each restaurant has:
//restaurantId (unique)
//name
//menu (a list of food items with foodId, name, price)
//location
//You should be able to add multiple restaurants.
//Search Restaurants by Location
//
//Given a location, return all available restaurants in that area.
//Add a Food Item to the Menu
//
//Add a new food item to an existing restaurantâ€™s menu.
//Place an Order
//
//The user should be able to place an order by:
//Selecting a restaurant
//Adding food items to the cart
//Confirming the order
//The system should generate a unique orderId with:
//restaurantId
//    userId
//List of food items
//totalAmount
//View Order History
//
//Given a userId, fetch all previous orders with details.
//    âœ… Constraints:
//Use OOP principles: Classes, encapsulation, and abstraction.
//Handle edge cases (e.g., invalid restaurant IDs, empty menu, invalid user ID).
//Write clear and modular code.
//Assume data is stored in memory (no need for a database).
